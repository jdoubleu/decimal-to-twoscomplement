# Ra web-decimal-to-twoscomplement
This theme was auto-generated by https://gitlab.com/jdoubleu/frontend-boilerplate-generator (powered by [Yeoman[(http://yeoman.io/)) and is based on [https://gitlab.com/jdoubleu/frontend-boilerplate](https://gitlab.com/jdoubleu/frontend-boilerplate).

## Motivation
The exercise of the lecture "Computer Architecture" in my course of studies was to implement 
a program which converts decimal numbers interpreted as ASCII strings into [two's complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement) in binary, octal and hexadecimal representation.

Against the exercise I decided to realise this program using JavaScript and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/ instead of Java.
I did so because I wanted to learn [Vue](https://vuejs.org/).

I also used [Google's Material Design](https://getmdl.io/).
